Implemented sessions, but not cookies for closing browser and remembering. Also didn't set up password recovery.

also skipped destroying users.

My current plan is to not include creating or destroying users and use it at the command line of the server. So the destroy and create commands are not included. They aren't added in the controllers, but the create views exist. The destroy is not present. Follow ch 10 destroy code.
