This is a branch from December. It conceptualizes the project. I just tidied up some navigation issues.


The basic idea here is to create a browsable store with videos that highlight products and product reviews.  Right now it just has filler videos and some filler content. Major issues are: cookies aren't enabled, no password recovery, no admin functionality and product features are inflexible. At the time I was fleshing out what it would look like, and how a user might interact with the site.
